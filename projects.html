        <h1><i>PROJECTS</i></h1>
        <h3>1. Portfolio Website</h3>
<p><h4>I designed and developed my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, education, and projects.
     The site features a clean layout, smooth scrolling, and responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.
     It acts as a central place where visitors can learn more about me and explore my work.</h4></p><br>
     <h3>2. Blog Website</h3>
<p><h4>I built a static blog website where I can share technical posts and tutorials.
 The site includes a homepage with post previews, individual blog pages, and a tag-based filtering system.
  I focused on UI consistency, readability, and mobile-friendly layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid.</h4></p>
<h3> 3. To-Do List App</h3>
<p><h4>This is a simple yet functional to-do list application built with JavaScript.
 It allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks, with data stored locally in the browser using localStorage. 
 This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence.</h4></p>
  <h3>4. Weather App</h3>
<p><h4>I developed a weather app that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
     Users can enter a city name to view temperature, humidity, and condition icons.
     This project strengthened my understanding of working with APIs and handling asynchronous JavaScript (using fetch).</h4></p>
<h3>5. Typing Speed Test</h3>
<p><h4>A fun and educational project where users can test their typing speed and accuracy.
 Built with vanilla JavaScript, the app displays random sentences and calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM) as users type.
 It includes a timer and real-time score display.</h4></p>
